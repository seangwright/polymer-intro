# Polymer Intro project

This project contains some explorations of component generation functionality provided by [Polymer 1.0](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/). 

## Included Elements
 * `two-way-binder` - Binds data between `input` element and `p` element content
 * `code-viewer` - Accepts code as input in `textarea` and then reproduces code, properly highlighted, below. Also allows for `textarea` and highlighted code to be cleared.
